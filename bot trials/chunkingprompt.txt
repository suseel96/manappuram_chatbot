Perform the following steps on the given file:
1. Analyze the file.
2. Divide the file's content into smaller semantic chunks with each chunk having context of it's hierarchy. The goal is to have smaller chunks which can be independently understood.
3. If there are any images, then provide the information that the image represents only if it has some meaning with respect to the document's content, else ignore.
4. If there are any tables, charts or images, convert them into meaningful sentences describing them in detail.
5. Each chunk of the output list should not exceed 4000 tokens. If it exceeds it, then recursively break it into smaller chunks.
6. The output should have entire content of the file without loss of any information.
7. Provide the output in the form of a python list. The output should only be a list. Do not provide any conclusive statements apart from the output list.
Example of expected output:
