  'content': "Manappuram Finance Ltd. is one of India's leading NBFCs focused mainly on gold loans. Promoted by Mr. V.P. Nandakumar (current MD & CEO), its origins go back to 1949 when it was founded in the coastal village of Valapad (Thrissur, Kerala) by his late father Mr V.C. Padmanabhan. The firm was involved in pawnbroking, and money lending carried out on a modest scale. Mr. Nandakumar took over the reins in 1986 after his father expired. Since then, it has been a story of unparalleled growth with many milestones crossed. Incorporated in 1992, Manappuram Finance Ltd. has grown at a rapid pace. Today, the company has a pan-India presence with 4,623 branches across 28 states and UTs and with Assets under Management (AUM) of ₹240,999.5 million. The company's net worth stood at ₹54,132.7 million as of December 31, 2020.",

The first non-banking financial company (NBFC) in Kerala to receive a Certificate of Registration issued by the RBI, it was also among the earliest to go for an IPO in 1995. In 2007, it became first Kerala based NBFC to receive investment from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) when the celebrated P.E. fund, Sequoia Capital, invested Rs.700 million along with Hudson Equity Holdings. Received sizable foreign investment of Rs.12,450 million during two QIPs in 2010. The second QIP in November 2010, which raised Rs.10,000 million remains the single largest foreign investment in U.S. dollar terms received by any company in Kerala to this date. Manappuram Finance Ltd. became the first NBFC in Kerala to undergo credit rating in 1995 and later obtain the highest short-term credit rating of A1+ from ICRA.',

  'content': 'When speaking of gold, India is often mentioned as holding the worlds\' largest stock of privately held gold with estimates ranging from 20 to 25,000 tonnes. Along with China, India is the largest consumer of gold and accounted for 23 percent of global demand between 2009-2018. Further, its physical stock Is supplemented every year by the largest import of gold, averaging about 700 to 800 tonnes per annum.\n\nHistorically, Indians have for ages had a particular affinity for gold. Gold jewellery takes pride of place in social and cultural occasions, and there is an emotional attachment to family gold jewellery, which often gets passed on from one generation to another.\n\nNot surprisingly, rural India holds the bulk of India\'s gold estimated at 60 to 65 percent of the total gold and 2/3rds of aggregate demand for gold comes from rural areas. What is more, gold in the Indian household usually belongs to the women (referred to as "Stridhana") and thus a source of empowerment for them. Lacking access to formal financial institutions (the banking network has limited reach in rural areas), gold is the preferred outlet for parking household savings in times of surplus. In times of need, gold is pledged to draw money. This is the origin of the age-old business of pawnbroking or lending against used household gold jewellery.',

  'content': 'Notwithstanding the rapid growth achieved by the organised players in gold loans (particularly the gold loan focussed non-banks), the market penetration is still quite low. Most private gold remains locked up in safes and vaults. Only a fraction of the gold has been monetised. Total gold loans outstanding in the organised sector in 2019 is estimated at just 5.5 percent of the household gold holdings in India, hinting at the potential of a large and mostly untapped market. With the increasing ease in monetising gold and growing economic activity in rural India, demand for gold loan will inevitably increase.',

  'content': "The Gold loan sector continues to be dominated by unorganised players who still command an estimated 65 percent market share. This is partly due to the fact that organised players were relatively late entrants and they could make an impact only in the last two decades with the rise of gold-loan focussed non-banks. Also, with the bulk of gold being held in rural areas, beyond the reach of the banking network, moneylenders and pawnbrokers operating in lanes and by-lanes could remain in business and flourish. However, with developments in recent years such as Demonetisation (2016) and the nation-wide rollout of GST (2017) hastening the pace of formalisation of India's economy, organised sector gold loan players have a better opportunity to grow business by taking market share away from unorganised players.",

  'content': 'After the sharp correction in the gold price in 2013, prices remained depressed for a couple of years. However, from 2016 onwards (especially after the Brexit vote and the U.S. election) gold prices have steadily gained. While the general impression attributes it to the unsettled global order following the ascension of Donald Trump as U.S. President (after all, gold is traditionally a safe haven asset), we believe there is a more fundamental force at work. This has to do with the continuing inability of the U.S. Fed and other central banks of the advanced economies to come out of the unprecedented easy money policies introduced in 2008-09 to counter the global financial crisis which keeps the opportunity cost (of holding gold) low. As of now, there seems to be no end in sight to central banks pushing for low-interest rates and that will surely support gold prices.',

  'content': 'Better placed to ride out global financial storms: A significant part of the demand for gold loans is derived from and dependent upon economic activity levels in rural areas, especially from agriculture and micro-enterprises. A slowdown in economic activity will certainly affect demand for gold loans on this account. However, our experience is that in periods of acute economic slowdown or crisis, the wider financial services sector (banks and non-banks) is also put to stress such that their lending activity slows down drastically. The appetite for risk and disbursing new loans falls. At this point, gold loans become the natural fall-back for borrowers denied access to their regular channels, and this new demand more than compensates for the loss of demand from traditional sources.',

  'content': 'As mentioned above, with the faster pace of formalisation of the economy now, the organised gold loan players can expect to gain market share from the unorganised players. However, compared to the banks, the focussed non-banks are better placed here because their low-cost model makes it easier to open new branches in rural and semi-urban areas. Since banks have much higher operating cost, they would hesitate to venture in these parts given the limited potential for other business.',

  'content': 'Short-term gold loans: Traditionally, gold loans were sanctioned for a tenure of one year, and borrowers were allowed to make bullet payments of interest and principal. This makes it very flexible for the borrower. However, the downside of this became visible in 2013 when a sudden and sharp correction in gold prices led to higher defaults and credit losses. In response, the industry as-a-whole shifted to periodic (monthly) collection of interest to preserve its lending margins. However, Manappuram Finance decided to break from convention and went further to launch short term gold loan products, mainly of three and six months tenure. Over the years since, the company has succeeded in shifting the bulk of its gold loans to the short-term buckets, which minimises the price risk.',

The OGL product is potentially a game-changer because it adds unprecedented convenience to the gold loan process and therefore makes it attractive to borrowers from a higher socio-economic profile who otherwise would not have considered a gold loan. Today, OGL accounts for about 44 per cent of its total gold loan AUM.',

In March 2019, India's premier lending institution, NABARD, sanctioned a term loan of Rs. 7,700 million meant to be deployed for onward lending to the MSME and microfinance sectors. In June 2019, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a subsidiary of World Bank, sanctioned a 3-year term loan of US$75 million, the first-ever external commercial borrowing (ECB) availed by the company. This was IFC's very first gold loan focused investment. In January 2020, the company raised US$300 million by way of senior secured fixed rate notes issuance for a three-year tenor.
